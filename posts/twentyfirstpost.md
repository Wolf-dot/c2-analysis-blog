> How many packets were observed for the SMTP traffic?

The SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol used to send the email to an SMTP server, more specifically to a Mail Submission Agent (MSA) or a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA). I filtered the SMTP traffic by putting in `smtp` and the number of packets can be found on the bottom threshold of the window.
