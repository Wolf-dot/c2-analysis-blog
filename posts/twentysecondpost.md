ðŸŽ‰ Thank you so much for reading and good job if you gave the room a try! ðŸŽ‰

I have learned a lot while doing this room and it was a lot of fun! I really enjoy playing a detective's role.
I also really enjoyed playing an evil mastermind's role while becoming an attacker and planting my own RAT in my [C2 RAT Project](https://r-proxy-rat.netlify.app/)! Please check it out!
