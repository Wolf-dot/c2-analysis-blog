> What is the domain name for the first IP address of the Cobalt Strike server? You may use VirusTotal to confirm if it's the Cobalt Strike server (check the Community tab). 

We can use Virustotal again, input the IP address and the domain name is reported in the community tab or you can find it in the Details tab at "Lat HTTPS Certificate".
