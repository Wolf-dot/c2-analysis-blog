For our second scenario let's use HTTPS to connect Victim directly to the Attacker.

Start the capture.

Connect with the agent to merlin server.

We can see it's connected on both ends as well as some packets that were exchanged.

Let's send a command through merlin, a simple `ls`.

After we receive it let's pause packet capture with CTRL + C. And let's stop the agent and server for now too.
