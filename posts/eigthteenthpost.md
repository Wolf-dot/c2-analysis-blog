> The malware used an API to check for the IP address of the victimâ€™s machine. What was the date and time when the DNS query for the IP check domain occurred? (answer format: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss UTC)

I filtered by the victim's IP address, DNS, and a keyword "api". The query: `ip.addr == 10.9.23.102 && dns && frame contains "api"`.
