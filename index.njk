<p>
We're going to walk through a TryHackMe room called <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/c2carnage">Carage</a>.</br>
In this room we're tasked with retreiving information from a packet capture following a *C2 attack*.</br>
I think it greately compliments my <a href="https://r-proxy-rat.netlify.app/">reverse-proxy RAT</a> project where we stood on the side of the attacker.
